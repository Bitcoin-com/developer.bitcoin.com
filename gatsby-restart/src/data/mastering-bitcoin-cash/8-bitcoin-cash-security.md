Securing bitcoin cash is challenging because it’s not an abstract reference to value, like a balance in a bank account. Bitcoin Cash is very much like digital cash or gold. You’ve probably heard the expression, 'Possession is nine-tenths of the law.' Well, in bitcoin cash, possession is ten-tenths of the law. Possession of the keys to unlock the bitcoin cash is equivalent to possession of cash or a chunk of precious metal. You can lose it, misplace it, have it stolen, or accidentally give the wrong amount to someone. In every one of these cases, users have no recourse, just as if they dropped cash on a public sidewalk.
