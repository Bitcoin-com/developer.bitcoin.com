Ownership of bitcoin cash is established through digital keys, addresses, and digital signatures. The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored by users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. The digital keys in a user’s wallet are completely independent of the bitcoin cash protocol and can be generated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the Internet. Keys enable many of the interesting properties of bitcoin cash, including de-centralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the cryptographic-proof security model.
