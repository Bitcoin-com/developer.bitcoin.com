Transactions are the most important part of the bitcoin cash system. Everything else in bitcoin cash is designed to ensure that transactions can be created, propagated on the network, validated, and finally added to the global ledger of transactions (the blockchain). Transactions are data structures that encode the transfer of value between participants in the bitcoin cash system. Each transaction is a public entry in bitcoin cashâ€™s blockchain, the global double-entry bookkeeping ledger.
