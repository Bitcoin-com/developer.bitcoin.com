Mining is the process by which new bitcoin cash is added to the money supply. Mining also serves to secure the bitcoin cash system against fraudulent transactions or transactions spending the same amount of bitcoins more than once, known as a double-spend. Miners provide processing power to the bitcoin cash network in exchange for the opportunity to be rewarded bitcoin cash.
