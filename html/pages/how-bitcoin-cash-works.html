                <p>The bitcoin cash system, unlike traditional banking and payment systems, is based on de-centralized trust. Instead of a central trusted authority, in bitcoin cash, trust is achieved as an emergent property from the interactions of different participants
                  in the bitcoin cash system. In this chapter, we will examine bitcoin cash from a high level by tracking a single transaction through the bitcoin cash system and watch as it becomes "trusted" and accepted by the bitcoin cash mechanism of distributed consensus
                  and is finally recorded on the blockchain, the distributed ledger of all transactions.</p>

              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>Each example is based on an actual transaction made on the bitcoin cash network, simulating the interactions between the users (Joe, Alice, and Bob) by sending funds from one wallet to another. While tracking a transaction through the bitcoin cash network
                  and blockchain, we will use a <em>blockchain explorer</em> site to visualize each step. A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin cash search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks
                  and see the relationships and flows between them.</p>

                  <p>In the overview diagram shown in <a href="#bitcoin-overview">Bitcoin Cash overview</a>, we see that the bitcoin cash system consists of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated across the network, and miners who produce (through
                    competitive computation) the consensus blockchain, which is the authoritative ledger of all transactions. In this chapter, we will trace a single transaction as it travels across the network and examine the interactions between each part
                    of the bitcoin cash system, at a high level. Subsequent chapters will delve into the technology behind wallets, mining, and merchant systems.</p>

                  <p>Alice, introduced in the previous chapter, is a new user who has just acquired her first bitcoin cash. In <a href="#getting_first_bitcoin">[getting_first_bitcoin]</a>, Alice met with her friend Joe to exchange some cash for bitcoin cash. The transaction
                    created by Joe funded Alice&#8217;s wallet with 0.10 BTC. Now Alice will make her first retail transaction, buying a cup of coffee at Bob&#8217;s coffee shop in Palo Alto, California. Bob&#8217;s coffee shop recently started accepting bitcoin cash
                    payments, by adding a bitcoin cash option to his point-of-sale system. The prices at Bob&#8217;s Cafe are listed in the local currency (US dollars), but at the register, customers have the option of paying in either dollars or bitcoin cash. Alice
                    places her order for a cup of coffee and Bob enters the transaction at the register. The point-of-sale system will convert the total price from US dollars to bitcoin cashs at the prevailing market rate and display the prices in both currencies,
                    as well as show a QR code containing a <em>payment request</em> for this transaction (see <a href="#payment-request-QR">Payment request QR code (Hint: Try to scan this!)</a>):</p>

                <p>In simple terms, a transaction tells the network that the owner of a number of bitcoins has authorized the transfer of some of those bitcoins to another owner. The new owner can now spend these bitcoins by creating another transaction that authorizes
                  transfer to another owner, and so on, in a chain of ownership.</p>

                <p>Transactions are like lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger. In simple terms, each transaction contains one or more "inputs," which are debits against a bitcoin cash account. On the other side of the transaction, there are one or more "outputs,"
                  which are credits added to a bitcoin cash account. The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do not necessarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less than inputs and the difference represents an implied "transaction
                  fee," which is a small payment collected by the miner who includes the transaction in the ledger. A bitcoin cash transaction is shown as a bookkeeping ledger entry in <a href="#transaction-double-entry">Transaction as double-entry bookkeeping</a>.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>The transaction also contains proof of ownership for each amount of bitcoin cash (inputs) whose value is transferred, in the form of a digital signature from the owner, which can be independently validated by anyone. In bitcoin cash terms, "spending"
                  is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a bitcoin cash address.</p>

                            as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating a chain of ownership as the value is moved from address to address (see <a href="#blockchain-mnemonic">A chain of transactions, where the output of one transaction is the input of the next transaction</a>).</p>

                <p>Alice&#8217;s payment to Bob&#8217;s Cafe uses a previous transaction as its input. In the previous chapter Alice received bitcoin cash from her friend Joe in return for cash. That transaction has a number of bitcoin cashs locked (encumbered) against
                  Alice&#8217;s key. Her new transaction to Bob&#8217;s Cafe references the previous transaction as an input and creates new outputs to pay for the cup of coffee and receive change. The transactions form a chain, where the inputs from the latest
                  transaction correspond to outputs from previous transactions. Alice&#8217;s key provides the signature that unlocks those previous transaction outputs, thereby proving to the bitcoin cash network that she owns the funds. She attaches the payment
                  for coffee to Bob&#8217;s address, thereby "encumbering" that output with the requirement that Bob produces a signature in order to spend that amount. This represents a transfer of value between Alice and Bob. This chain of transactions, from

                    application that runs as a full-index client actually contains a copy of every unspent output from every transaction in the blockchain. This allows a wallet to construct transaction inputs as well as quickly verify incoming transactions
                    as having correct inputs. However, because a full-index client takes up a lot of disk space, most user wallets run "lightweight" clients that track only the user&#8217;s own unspent outputs.</p>

                <div className="paragraph">
                  <p>If the wallet application does not maintain a copy of unspent transaction outputs, it can query the bitcoin cash network to retrieve this information, using a variety of APIs available by different providers or by asking a full-index node using
                    the bitcoin cash JSON RPC API. <a href="#example_2-1">Look up all the unspent outputs for Alice&#8217;s bitcoin cash address</a> shows a RESTful API request, constructed as an HTTP GET command to a specific URL. This URL will return all the unspent
                    transaction outputs for an address, giving any application the information it needs to construct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line HTTP client <em>cURL</em> to retrieve the response.</p>

                    like picking coins from a purse until it could find enough to pay for coffee. In both cases, there might be a need to get some change back, which we will see in the next section, as the wallet application creates the transaction outputs

                <div className="paragraph">
                  <p>A transaction output is created in the form of a script that creates an encumbrance on the value and can only be redeemed by the introduction of a solution to the script. In simpler terms, Alice&#8217;s transaction output will contain a script
                    that says something like, "This output is payable to whoever can present a signature from the key corresponding to Bob&#8217;s public address." Because only Bob has the wallet with the keys corresponding to that address, only Bob&#8217;s
                    wallet can present such a signature to redeem this output. Alice will therefore "encumber" the output value with a demand for a signature from Bob.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="paragraph">
                  <p>This transaction will also include a second output, because Alice&#8217;s funds are in the form of a 0.10 BTC output, too much money for the 0.015 BTC cup of coffee. Alice will need 0.085 BTC in change. Alice&#8217;s change payment is created
                    <em>by Alice&#8217;s wallet</em> in the very same transaction as the payment to Bob. Essentially, Alice&#8217;s wallet breaks her funds into two payments: one to Bob, and one back to herself. She can then use the change output in a subsequent
                    transaction, thus spending it later.</p>

                <div className="paragraph">
                  <p>Finally, for the transaction to be processed by the network in a timely fashion, Alice&#8217;s wallet application will add a small fee. This is not explicit in the transaction; it is implied by the difference between inputs and outputs. If
                    instead of taking 0.085 in change, Alice creates only 0.0845 as the second output, there will be 0.0005 BTC (half a millibitcoin) left over. The input&#8217;s 0.10 BTC is not fully spent with the two outputs, because they will add up to
                    less than 0.10. The resulting difference is the <em>transaction fee</em> that is collected by the miner as a fee for including the transaction in a block and putting it on the blockchain ledger.</p>

                      wallet directly and she does not have to use the Internet connection offered by the cafe, though both those options are possible, too. Any bitcoin cash network node (other client) that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before will
                      immediately forward it to other nodes to which it is connected. Thus, the transaction rapidly propagates out across the peer-to-peer network, reaching a large percentage of the nodes within a few seconds.</p>

                      through other nodes, it will reach Bob&#8217;s wallet within a few seconds. Bob&#8217;s wallet will immediately identify Alice&#8217;s transaction as an incoming payment because it contains outputs redeemable by Bob&#8217;s keys. Bob&#8217;s
                      wallet application can also independently verify that the transaction is well formed, uses previously unspent inputs, and contains sufficient transaction fees to be included in the next block. At this point Bob can assume, with little
                      risk, that the transaction will shortly be included in a block and confirmed.</p>

                <p>The transaction is now propagated on the bitcoin cash network. It does not become part of the shared ledger (the <em>blockchain</em>) until it is verified and included in a block by a process called <em>mining</em>. See <a href="#ch8">[ch8]</a> for

                <p>The bitcoin cash system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are bundled into <em>blocks</em>, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only a small amount of computation to verify as proven. The mining process serves
                  two purposes in bitcoin cash:</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Mining creates trust by ensuring that transactions are only confirmed if enough computational power was devoted to the block that contains them. More blocks mean more computation, which means more trust.</p>

                <p>A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant
                  sudoku puzzle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed puzzle you can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares filled and the rest are empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty
                  of the sudoku can be adjusted by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be verified quite easily even if it is very large. The "puzzle" used in bitcoin cash is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics:
                  it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted.</p>

              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>In <a href="#user-stories">[user-stories]</a>, we introduced Jing, a computer engineering student in Shanghai. Jing is participating in the bitcoin cash network as a miner. Every 10 minutes or so, Jing joins thousands of other miners in a global
                  race to find a solution to a block of transactions. Finding such a solution, the so-called proof of work, requires quadrillions of hashing operations per second across the entire bitcoin cash network. The algorithm for proof of work involves repeatedly
                  hashing the header of the block and a random number with the SHA256 cryptographic algorithm until a solution matching a predetermined pattern emerges. The first miner to find such a solution wins the round of competition and publishes that
                  block into the blockchain.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>Jing started mining in 2010 using a very fast desktop computer to find a suitable proof of work for new blocks. As more miners started joining the bitcoin cash network, the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other miners
                  upgraded to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical processing units (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the time of this writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only
                  to mine with application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining algorithms printed in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip. Jing also joined a "mining pool," which much like a lottery pool allows
                  several participants to share their efforts and the rewards. Jing now runs two USB-connected ASIC machines to mine for bitcoin cash 24 hours a day. He pays his electricity costs by selling the bitcoin cash he is able to generate from mining, creating
                  some income from the profits. His computer runs a copy of bitcoind, the reference bitcoin cash client, as a backend to his specialized mining software.</p>

              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>A transaction transmitted across the network is not verified until it becomes part of the global distributed ledger, the blockchain. Every 10 minutes on average, miners generate a new block that contains all the transactions since the last block.
                  New transactions are constantly flowing into the network from user wallets and other applications. As these are seen by the bitcoin cash network nodes, they get added to a temporary pool of unverified transactions maintained by each node. As miners
                  build a new block, they add unverified transactions from this pool to a new block and then attempt to solve a very hard problem (a.k.a., proof of work) to prove the validity of that new block. The process of mining is explained in detail in
                  <a href="#mining">[mining]</a>.</p>

              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>Transactions are added to the new block, prioritized by the highest-fee transactions first and a few other criteria. Each miner starts the process of mining a new block of transactions as soon as he receives the previous block from the network,
                  knowing he has lost that previous round of competition. He immediately creates a new block, fills it with transactions and the fingerprint of the previous block, and starts calculating the proof of work for the new block. Each miner includes
                  a special transaction in his block, one that pays his own bitcoin cash address a reward of newly created bitcoins (currently 25 BTC per block). If he finds a solution that makes that block valid, he "wins" this reward because his successful block
                  is added to the global blockchain and the reward transaction he included becomes spendable. Jing, who participates in a mining pool, has set up his software to create new blocks that assign the reward to a pool address. From there, a share
                  of the reward is distributed to Jing and other miners in proportion to the amount of work they contributed in the last round.</p>

                <p>Alice&#8217;s transaction was picked up by the network and included in the pool of unverified transactions. Because it had sufficient fees, it was included in a new block generated by Jing&#8217;s mining pool. Approximately five minutes after
                  the transaction was first transmitted by Alice&#8217;s wallet, Jing&#8217;s ASIC miner found a solution for the block and published it as block #277316, containing 419 other transactions. Jing&#8217;s ASIC miner published the new block on
                  the bitcoin cash network, where other miners validated it and started the race to generate the next block.</p>

                <p>You can see the block that includes <a href="https://blockchain.info/block-height/277316">Alice&#8217;s transaction</a>.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>A few minutes later, a new block, #277317, is mined by another miner. Because this new block is based on the previous block (#277316) that contained Alice&#8217;s transaction, it added even more computation on top of that block, thereby strengthening
                  the trust in those transactions. The block containing Alice&#8217;s transaction is counted as one "confirmation" of that transaction. Each block mined on top of the one containing the transaction is an additional confirmation. As the blocks
                  pile on top of each other, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse the transaction, thereby making it more and more trusted by the network.</p>

                <p>In the diagram in <a href="#block-alice1">Alice&#8217;s transaction included in block #277316</a> we can see block #277316, which contains Alice&#8217;s transaction. Below it are 277,316 blocks (including block #0), linked to each other in a
                  chain of blocks (blockchain) all the way back to block #0, known as the <em>genesis block</em>. Over time, as the "height" in blocks increases, so does the computation difficulty for each block and the chain as a whole. The blocks mined after
                  the one that contains Alice&#8217;s transaction act as further assurance, as they pile on more computation in a longer and longer chain. By convention, any block with more than six confirmations is considered irrevocable, because it would
                  require an immense amount of computation to invalidate and recalculate six blocks. We will examine the process of mining and the way it builds trust in more detail in <a href="#ch8">[ch8]</a>.</p>

                <p>Now that Alice&#8217;s transaction has been embedded in the blockchain as part of a block, it is part of the distributed ledger of bitcoin cash and visible to all bitcoin cash applications. Each bitcoin cash client can independently verify the transaction
                  as valid and spendable. Full-index clients can track the source of the funds from the moment the bitcoins were first generated in a block, incrementally from transaction to transaction, until they reach Bob&#8217;s address. Lightweight clients
                  can do what is called a simplified payment verification (see <a href="#spv_nodes">[spv_nodes]</a>) by confirming that the transaction is in the blockchain and has several blocks mined after it, thus providing assurance that the network accepts
                  it as valid.</p>

              <div className="paragraph">
                <p>Bob can now spend the output from this and other transactions, by creating his own transactions that reference these outputs as their inputs and assign them new ownership. For example, Bob can pay a contractor or supplier by transferring value
                  from Alice&#8217;s coffee cup payment to these new owners. Most likely, Bob&#8217;s bitcoin cash software will aggregate many small payments into a larger payment, perhaps concentrating all the day&#8217;s bitcoin cash revenue into a single transaction.
                  This would move the various payments into a single address, used as the store&#8217;s general "checking" account. For a diagram of an aggregating transaction, see <a href="#transaction-aggregating">Transaction aggregating funds</a>.</p>

                <p>As Bob spends the payments received from Alice and other customers, he extends the chain of transactions, which in turn are added to the global blockchain ledger for all to see and trust. Let&#8217;s assume that Bob pays his web designer Gopesh
                  in Bangalore for a new website page. Now the chain of transactions will look like <a href="#block-alice2">Alice&#8217;s transaction as part of a transaction chain from Joe to Gopesh</a>.</p>
