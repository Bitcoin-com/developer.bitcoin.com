                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The blockchain data structure is an ordered, back-linked list of blocks of transactions. The blockchain can be stored as a flat file, or in a simple database. The Bitcoin Core client stores the blockchain metadata using Google&#8217;s LevelDB
                    database. Blocks are linked "back," each referring to the previous block in the chain. The blockchain is often visualized as a vertical stack, with blocks layered on top of each other and the first block serving as the foundation of the stack.
                    The visualization of blocks stacked on top of each other results in the use of terms such as "height" to refer to the distance from the first block, and "top" or "tip" to refer to the most recently added block.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Each block within the blockchain is identified by a hash, generated using the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block also references a previous block, known as the <em>parent</em> block, through the "previous
                    block hash" field in the block header. In other words, each block contains the hash of its parent inside its own header. The sequence of hashes linking each block to its parent creates a chain going back all the way to the first block ever created,
                    known as the <em>genesis block</em>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Although a block has just one parent, it can temporarily have multiple children. Each of the children refers to the same block as its parent and contains the same (parent) hash in the "previous block hash" field. Multiple children arise during
                    a blockchain "fork," a temporary situation that occurs when different blocks are discovered almost simultaneously by different miners (see <a href="#forks">[forks]</a>). Eventually, only one child block becomes part of the blockchain and the
                    "fork" is resolved. Even though a block may have more than one child, each block can have only one parent. This is because a block has one single "previous block hash" field referencing its single parent.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The "previous block hash" field is inside the block header and thereby affects the <em>current</em> block&#8217;s hash. The child&#8217;s own identity changes if the parent&#8217;s identity changes. When the parent is modified in any way, the
                    parent&#8217;s hash changes. The parent&#8217;s changed hash necessitates a change in the "previous block hash" pointer of the child. This in turn causes the child&#8217;s hash to change, which requires a change in the pointer of the grandchild,
                    which in turn changes the grandchild, and so on. This cascade effect ensures that once a block has many generations following it, it cannot be changed without forcing a recalculation of all subsequent blocks. Because such a recalculation would
                    require enormous computation, the existence of a long chain of blocks makes the blockchain&#8217;s deep history immutable, which is a key feature of bitcoin cash&#8217;s security.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>One way to think about the blockchain is like layers in a geological formation, or glacier core sample. The surface layers might change with the seasons, or even be blown away before they have time to settle. But once you go a few inches deep,
                    geological layers become more and more stable. By the time you look a few hundred feet down, you are looking at a snapshot of the past that has remained undisturbed for millions of years. In the blockchain, the most recent few blocks might be
                    revised if there is a chain recalculation due to a fork. The top six blocks are like a few inches of topsoil. But once you go more deeply into the blockchain, beyond six blocks, blocks are less and less likely to change. After 100 blocks back
                    there is so much stability that the coinbase transaction—the transaction containing newly mined bitcoins—can be spent. A few thousand blocks back (a month) and the blockchain is settled history, for all practical purposes. While the protocol
                    always allows a chain to be undone by a longer chain and while the possibility of any block being reversed always exists, the probability of such an event decreases as time passes until it becomes infinitesimal.</p>

                  <p>A block is a container data structure that aggregates transactions for inclusion in the public ledger, the blockchain. The block is made of a header, containing metadata, followed by a long list of transactions that make up the bulk of its size.
                    The block header is 80 bytes, whereas the average transaction is at least 250 bytes and the average block contains more than 500 transactions. A complete block, with all transactions, is therefore 1,000 times larger than the block header.

                  <p>The primary identifier of a block is its cryptographic hash, a digital fingerprint, made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. The resulting 32-byte hash is called the <em>block hash</em> but is more accurately the <em>block header hash</em>,
                    <phrase role="keep-together">because only the block header is used to compute it. For example,</phrase> 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f is the block hash of the first bitcoin cash block ever created. The block hash identifies a block uniquely
                    and unambiguously and can be independently derived by any node by simply hashing the block header.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Note that the block hash is not actually included inside the block&#8217;s data structure, neither when the block is transmitted on the network, nor when it is stored on a node&#8217;s persistence storage as part of the blockchain. Instead, the
                    block&#8217;s hash is computed by each node as the block is received from the network. The block hash might be stored in a separate database table as part of the block&#8217;s metadata, to facilitate indexing and faster retrieval of blocks from
                    disk.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>A second way to identify a block is by its position in the blockchain, called the
                    <phrase role="keep-together">
                      <emphasis>block height</emphasis>. The first block ever created is at block height 0 (zero) and is the</phrase>

                    height. Each subsequent block added "on top" of that first block is one position "higher" in the blockchain, like boxes stacked one on top of the other. The block height on January 1, 2014, was approximately 278,000, meaning there were 278,000
                    blocks stacked on top of the first block created in January 2009.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Unlike the block hash, the block height is not a unique identifier. Although a single block will always have a specific and invariant block height, the reverse is not true—the block height does not always identify a single block. Two or more blocks
                    might have the same block height, competing for the same position in the blockchain. This scenario is discussed in detail in the section <a href="#forks">[forks]</a>. The block height is also not a part of the block&#8217;s data structure; it

                  <p>Merkle trees are used in bitcoin cash to summarize all the transactions in a block, producing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions, providing a very efficient process to verify whether a transaction is included in a block.
                    A Merkle tree is constructed by recursively hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one hash, called the <em>root</em>, or <em>merkle root</em>. The cryptographic hash algorithm used in bitcoin cash&#8217;s merkle trees is SHA256 applied twice,

                  <p>The merkle tree is constructed bottom-up. In the following example, we start with four transactions, A, B, C and D, which form the <em>leaves</em> of the Merkle tree, as shown in <a href="#simple_merkle">Calculating the nodes in a merkle tree</a>.
                    The transactions are not stored in the merkle tree; rather, their data is hashed and the resulting hash is stored in each leaf node as H<sub>A</sub>, H<sub>B</sub>, H<sub>C</sub>, and H<sub>D</sub>:</p>

                    to create a 64-byte string. That string is then double-hashed to produce the parent node&#8217;s hash:</p>

                  <p>The same method for constructing a tree from four transactions can be generalized to construct trees of any size. In bitcoin cash it is common to have several hundred to more than a thousand transactions in a single block, which are summarized in exactly
                    the same way, producing just 32 bytes of data as the single merkle root. In <a href="#merkle_tree_large">A merkle tree summarizing many data elements</a>, you will see a tree built from 16 transactions. Note that although the root looks bigger
                    than the leaf nodes in the diagram, it is the exact same size, just 32 bytes. Whether there is one transaction or a hundred thousand transactions in the block, the merkle root always summarizes them into 32 bytes.</p>

                  <p>To prove that a specific transaction is included in a block, a node only needs to produce log~2~(N) 32-byte hashes, constituting an <em>authentication path</em> or <em>merkle path</em> connecting the specific transaction to the root of the tree.
                    This is especially important as the number of transactions increases, because the base-2 logarithm of the number of transactions increases much more slowly. This allows bitcoin cash nodes to efficiently produce paths of 10 or 12 hashes (320–384 bytes),
                    which can provide proof of a single transaction out of more than a thousand transactions in a megabyte-size block.</p>

                    <p>As you can see from the table, while the block size increases rapidly, from 4 KB with 16 transactions to a block size of 16 MB to fit 65,535 transactions, the merkle path required to prove the inclusion of a transaction increases much more slowly,
                      from 128 bytes to only 512 bytes. With merkle trees, a node can download just the block headers (80 bytes per block) and still be able to identify a transaction&#8217;s inclusion in a block by retrieving a small merkle path from a full node,
                      without storing or transmitting the vast majority of the blockchain, which might be several gigabytes in size. Nodes that do not maintain a full blockchain, called simplified payment verification (SPV nodes), use merkle paths to verify transactions
                      without downloading full blocks.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Merkle trees are used extensively by SPV nodes. SPV nodes don&#8217;t have all transactions and do not download full blocks, just block headers. In order to verify that a transaction is included in a block, without having to download all the transactions
                    in the block, they use an authentication path, or merkle path.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Consider, for example, an SPV node that is interested in incoming payments to an address contained in its wallet. The SPV node will establish a bloom filter on its connections to peers to limit the transactions received to only those containing
                    addresses of interest. When a peer sees a transaction that matches the bloom filter, it will send that block using a merkleblock message. The merkleblock message contains the block header as well as a merkle path that links the transaction of
                    interest to the merkle root in the block. The SPV node can use this merkle path to connect the transaction to the block and verify that the transaction is included in the block. The SPV node also uses the block header to link the block to the
                    rest of the blockchain. The combination of these two links, between the transaction and block, and between the block and blockchain, proves that the transaction is recorded in the blockchain. All in all, the SPV node will have received less
                    than a kilobyte of data for the block header and merkle path, an amount of data that is more than a thousand times less than a full block (about 1 megabyte currently).</p>
