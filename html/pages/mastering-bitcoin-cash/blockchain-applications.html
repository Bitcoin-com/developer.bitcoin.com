              <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Let’s now build on our understanding of bitcoin by looking at it as an application platform. Nowadays, many people use the term "blockchain" to refer to any application platform that shares the design principles of bitcoin. The term is often misused and applied to many things that fail to deliver the primary features that bitcoin’s blockchain delivers.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In this chapter we will look at the features offered by the bitcoin blockchain, as an application platform. We will consider the application building primitives, which form the building blocks of any blockchain application. We will look at several important applications that use these primitives, such as colored coins, payment (state) channels, and routed payment channels (Lightning Network).</p>

                <h3 class='yellow' id="_introduction">Introduction</h3>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The bitcoin system was designed as a decentralized currency and payment system. However, most of its functionality is derived from much lower-level constructs that can be used for much broader applications. Bitcoin wasn’t built with components such as accounts, users, balances, and payments. Instead, it uses a transactional scripting language with low-level cryptographic functions, as we saw in <a href="#transactions" alt="transactions">[transactions]</a>. Just as the higher-level concepts of accounts, balances, and payments can be derived from these basic primitives, so can many other complex applications. Thus, the bitcoin blockchain can become an application platform offering trust services to applications, such as smart contracts, far surpassing the original purpose of digital currency and payments.</p>

                  <p>When operating correctly and over the long term, the bitcoin system offers certain guarantees, which can be used as building blocks to create applications. These include:</p>

                        <p>The most fundamental guarantee of bitcoin’s decentralized consensus algorithm ensures that no UTXO can be spent twice.</p>

                      <dt class="hdlist1">Immutability</dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p>Once a transaction is recorded in the blockchain and sufficient work has been added with subsequent blocks, the transaction’s data becomes immutable. Immutability is underwritten by energy, as rewriting the blockchain requires the expenditure of energy to produce Proof-of-Work. The energy required and therefore the degree of immutability increases with the amount of work committed on top of the block containing a transaction.</p>

                        <p>The decentralized bitcoin network propagates valid transactions regardless of the origin or content of those transactions. This means that anyone can create a valid transaction with sufficient fees and trust they will be able to transmit that transaction and have it included in the blockchain at any time.</p>

                        <p>The consensus rules reject any block whose timestamp is too far in the past or future. This ensures that timestamps on blocks can be trusted. The timestamp on a block implies an unspent-before guarantee for the inputs of all included transactions.</p>

                    <h3 class='yellow' id="_colored_coins">Colored Coins</h3>
                  <p>The first blockchain application we will discuss is colored coins.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>Colored coins refers to a set of similar technologies that use bitcoin transactions to record the creation, ownership, and transfer of extrinsic assets other than bitcoin. By "extrinsic" we mean assets that are not stored directly on the bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to bitcoin itself, which is an asset intrinsic to the blockchain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The term derives from the idea of "coloring" or marking a nominal amount of bitcoin, for example, a single satoshi, to represent something other than the bitcoin value itself. As an analogy, consider stamping a $1 note with a message saying, "this is a stock certificate of ACME" or "this note can be redeemed for 1 oz of silver" and then trading the $1 note as a certificate of ownership of this other asset. The first implementation of colored coins, named Enhanced Padded-Order-Based Coloring or EPOBC, assigned extrinsic assets to a 1-satoshi output. In this way, it was a true "colored coin," as each asset was added as an attribute (color) of a single satoshi.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>More recent implementations of colored coins use the OP_RETURN script opcode to store metadata in a transaction, in conjunction with external data stores that associate the metadata to specific assets.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The two most prominent implementations of colored coins today are <a href="#" target="_blank">Open Assets</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">Colored Coins by Colu</a>. These two systems use different approaches to colored coins and are not compatible. Colored coins created in one system cannot be seen or used in the other system.</p>

                  <h4 class='yellow' id="_using_colored_coins">Using Colored Coins</h4>
                  <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Colored coins are created, transferred, and generally viewed in special wallets that can interpret the colored coins protocol metadata attached to bitcoin transactions. Special care must be taken to avoid using a colored-coin–related key in a regular bitcoin wallet, as the regular wallet may destroy the metadata. Similarly, colored coins should not be sent to addresses managed by regular wallets, but only to addresses that are managed by wallets that are colored-coin-aware. Both Colu and Open Assets systems use special colored-coin addresses to mitigate this risk and to ensure that colored coins are not sent to unaware wallets.</p>

                  <h4 class='yellow' id="_issuing_colored_coins">Issuing Colored Coins</h4>
                  <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Each of the colored coins implementations has a different way of creating colored coins, but they all provide similar functionality. The process of creating a colored coin asset is called issuance. An initial transaction, the issuance transaction registers the asset on the bitcoin blockchain and creates an asset ID that is used to reference the asset. Once issued, assets can be transferred between addresses using transfer transactions.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Assets issued as colored coins can have multiple properties. They can be divisible or indivisible, meaning that the amount of asset in a transfer can be an integer (e.g., 5) or have decimal subdivision (e.g., 4.321). Assets can also have fixed issuance, meaning a certain amount are issued only once, or can be reissued, meaning that new units of the asset can be issued by the original issuer after the initial issuance.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Finally, some colored coins enable dividends, allowing the distribution of bitcoin payments to the owners of a colored coin asset in proportion to their ownership.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

              <div class="sect2">
                <h3 class='yellow' id="_colored_coins_transactions">Colored Coins Transactions</h3>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The metadata that gives meaning to a colored coin transaction is usually stored in one of the outputs using the OP_RETURN opcode. Different colored coins protocols use different encodings for the content of the OP_RETURN data. The output containing the OP_RETURN is called the marker output.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The order of the outputs and position of the marker output may have special meaning in the colored coins protocol. In Open Assets, for example, any outputs before the marker output represent asset issuance. Any outputs after the marker represent asset transfer. The marker output assigns specific values and colors to the other outputs by referencing their order in the transaction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>In Colored Coins (Colu), by comparison, the marker output encodes an opcode that determines how the metadata is interpreted. Opcodes 0x01 through 0x0F indicate an issuance transaction. An issuance opcode is usually followed by an asset ID or other identifier that can be used to retrieve the asset information from an external source (e.g., bittorrent). Opcodes 0x10 through 0x1F represent a transfer transaction. Transfer transaction metadata contain simple scripts that transfer specific amounts of assets from inputs to outputs, by reference to their index. Ordering of inputs and outputs is therefore important in the interpretation of the script.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>If the metadata is too long to fit in OP_RETURN, the colored coins protocol may use other "tricks" to store metadata in a transaction. Examples include putting metadata in a redeem script, followed by OP_DROP opcodes to ensure the script ignores the metadata. Another mechanism used is a 1-of-N multisig script where only the first public key is a real public key that can spend the output and subsequent "keys" are replaced by encoded metadata.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>In order to correctly interpret the metadata in a colored coins transaction you must use a compatible wallet or block explorer. Otherwise, the transaction looks like a "normal" bitcoin transaction with an OP_RETURN output.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>As an example, I created and issued a MasterBTC asset using colored coins. The MasterBTC asset represents a voucher for a free copy of this book. These vouchers can be transferred, traded, and redeemed using a colored coins-compatible wallet.</p>

                    <p>Would you carry your entire net worth in cash in your wallet? Most people would consider that reckless, yet bitcoin cash users often keep all their bitcoin cash in a single wallet. Instead, users should spread the risk among multiple and diverse bitcoin cash
                      wallets. Prudent users will keep only a small fraction, perhaps less than 5%, of their bitcoin cash in an online or mobile wallet as "pocket change." The rest should be split between a few different storage mechanisms, such as a desktop wallet
                      and offline (cold storage).</p>

                    <p>Whenever a company or individual stores large amounts of bitcoin cash, they should consider using a multi-signature bitcoin cash address. Multi-signature addresses secure funds by requiring more than one signature to make a payment. The signing keys should
                      be stored in a number of different locations and under the control of different people. In a corporate environment, for example, the keys should be generated independently and held by several company executives, to ensure no single person
                      can compromise the funds. Multi-signature addresses can also offer redundancy, where a single person holds several keys that are stored in different locations.</p>

                    <p>One important security consideration that is often overlooked is availability, especially in the context of incapacity or death of the key holder. Bitcoin Cash users are told to use complex passwords and keep their keys secure and private, not sharing
                      them with anyone. Unfortunately, that practice makes it almost impossible for the user&#8217;s family to recover any funds if the user is not available to unlock them. In most cases, in fact, the families of bitcoin cash users might be completely
                      unaware of the existence of the bitcoin cash funds.</p>
