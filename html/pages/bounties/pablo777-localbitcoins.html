        <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
        <p>A user posting as Pablo777 offered to make a trade for 10.2 bitcoins for $7200 Canadian through the website <a href="http://www.localbitcoins.com.com">http://www.localbitcoins.com.com</a>
They asked for my banking information (transit, account, institution) and said they were depositing the money into my account. Sure enough, 24 hours later the money was deposited into my account. I went ahead and sent them 10.2 bitcoins. Since the money was for my wedding, I went to do a transfer to my fianc√©e to pay expenses when I discovered that my bank account was now "deposit only". I called the bank and apparently they got an email from the bank (Alberta Treasury Branch) where the money came from and the person said they did not authorize the transaction and it was fraud. My bank then froze the money and said the other bank had 90 days to pull the money out of my account, 30 days later they did. I didn't know you could reverse a bank transfer and my ignorance has made me loose that money. Here is all the information about the person who scammed me.</p>
