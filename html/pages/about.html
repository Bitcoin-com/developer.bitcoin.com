          <p class="lead">Anyone can contribute bitcoin to the bounty pool. Anyone who is a position to help catch the criminal can compile all of the details proving the person’s guilt, and submit a zero knowledge proof of the evidence using proofofexistence.com Then they contact the correct “authorities” and provide all the necessary details that lead to an arrest and conviction. Once there has been a conviction, contact us with with the evidence you submitted to proof of existence. If we agree that you were the earliest person, we will pay you the bounty.</p>
